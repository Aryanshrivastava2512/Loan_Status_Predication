##  Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected using Machine Learning classification algorithms.

The model analyzes applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and loan amount to determine loan approval status.

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison

- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self Employed
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount Term
- Credit History
- Property Area
- Loan Status (Target Variable: Approved / Not Approved)
